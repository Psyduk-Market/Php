                <p>This is Spot, he is a very good boy and he enjoys going to the park, especially in Autumn when the leaves have all fallen onto the ground and he can run around and roll in them.
                    Sometimes, if you are lucky he will bring you his favourite leaf. You may look at his leaf, but you may not touch it, the leaf is Spot's, and Spot's alone. Spot also loves belly rubs, playing fetch,
                    but most importantly he loves to chase cars down the road and bark at them.</p>

              <p>This is Franklin, he is a very bad boy and enjoys robbing banks, especially during the day when there is not many people around to stop him and he can run into the banks and rob them.
                Sometimes, if you are lucky, he will bring you his favourite balaclava. You may look at this balaclava, but you may not touch it, the balaclava is Franklin's and Franklin's alone.
                Initially, he lived in Detroit, moved to Brooklyn and now he lives in the Bronx. Before becoming a bank robber he worked in a pizza shop called DeMarco's pizza, but the place shutdown because of a fire.</p>
